[Telcoin Association](https://telcoin.org) is a non-profit organization whose mission is to represent the interests of GSMA Mobile Networks and other stakeholders in maintaining and developing the Telcoin Platform.

This Github Organization hosts all of Telcoin Association's open-source experiments, development, and production-ready code.

We are currently building:  
[Telcoin Labs](https://github.com/Telcoin-Association/telcoin-laboratories-contracts): a collection of on-chain programs comprising the Telcoin Association infrastructure.

Telcoin Network: the EVM-compatible L1 protocol for Mobile Network Operators (open-source repo coming soon)
